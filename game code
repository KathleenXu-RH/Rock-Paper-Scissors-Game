#Welcome to my first GitHub project! This repository contains a Python program for a classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game.

This game is played between a user and the computer. It follows these rules:
- Each player (user and computer) can choose Rock (1), Paper (2), or Scissors (3).
- The game continues for up to 5 rounds.
- A player wins a round by following the rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors.
  - Scissors beat Paper.
  - Paper beats Rock.
- The first player to reach 3 points or the player with the most points after 5 rounds wins the game.

How to Play:
- Run the script using Python.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to input your choice (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, or 3 for Scissors).
- The game will display the computer's choice and the results of each round.
- Enjoy the game!

Here are the codes:
print("This is a 5-rounds rock, paper, scissors game, and you are playing with computer.") 
print("rock is represented by 1, paper is represented by 2, scissor is represented by 3 .")

import random
from random import randint
userPoint = 0 
computerPoint = 0
roundNum = 0

while userPoint < 3 and computerPoint < 3 and roundNum < 5:
    userChoice = input("\ngive me a choice between 1,2,3")
    if userChoice == "1" or userChoice == "2" or userChoice == "3":
        userChoice = int(userChoice)
    else:
        print("Invalid choice!")
        continue 
    computerChoice = random.randint(1,3)
    roundNum = roundNum + 1
    print ("computer’s choice is", computerChoice)
    if userChoice == computerChoice:
        userPoint = userPoint
        computerPoint =computerPoint
        print("This is TIE!")
    elif userChoice == 1 and computerChoice == 3:
        userPoint = userPoint + 1
        print("User WINS!")
    elif userChoice == 2 and computerChoice == 1:
        userPoint = userPoint + 1
        print("User WINS!")
    elif userChoice == 3 and computerChoice == 2:
        userPoint = userPoint + 1
        print("User WINS!")
    else:
        computerPoint = computerPoint + 1
        print("Computer WINS!")
    print ("This round is round", roundNum)
    print ("The score is user-", userPoint,", computer-", computerPoint)
if userPoint == computerPoint:
    print("\nThis is TIE!")
elif userPoint > computerPoint:
    print ("\nUSER WINS!")
else:
    print ("\nCOMPUTER WINS！")
